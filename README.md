## INSTRUCTIONS

-Install all necessary dependencies and libraries with pip for example. Recommended to run in your own python environment.

-Using linux terminal locate the with the python file 'running.py'

-In this file modify values of INITIAL, GOAL_STATE, RADIUS_ROBOT and border.

-Run the command on terminal 'python3 running.py'

-The file 'pot_field.py' excecutes the potential field algorithm and the file 'bi_a_star.py' executes the bidirectional A* algorithm

-Two algorithms will run informing about the progress on the terminal.

-The program informs success or not. If success, it will finish by creating a plot comparing the solution of the different algorithms.
